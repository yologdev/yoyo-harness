# A research run must leave an advantage brief even when it files 0 issues. The
# agent is instructed to append one as its final step. If it forgot, we DON'T
# fail the whole run (the scan already happened, and a hard failure loses it and
# pages a human) — instead we degrade gracefully: append a minimal honest stub
# so the journal is never silently empty, and surface a warning so the omission
# stays visible. A run should always leave a journal entry behind.
