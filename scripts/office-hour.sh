Steps:

1. **Read project context** — README.md, YOYO.md, any roadmap docs.
   Understand the current phase so you can judge issue relevance.

2. **For each triage issue**, decide one of:
   a. **Groom → ready**: Issue is well-defined and aligns with the roadmap.
      - Remove "triage" label, add "ready" label
      - Add priority label (p0-critical, p1-high, p2-medium, p3-low)
      - Ensure the issue body has: Requirements, Files Involved, Acceptance Criteria
      - If any of these are missing, add them in a comment
      - Command: \`gh issue edit <N> --repo $REPO --remove-label "triage" --add-label "ready" --add-label "<priority>"\`

   b. **Reject → close**: Issue is out of scope, duplicate, or not aligned with vision.
      - Close with a comment explaining why
      - Command: \`gh issue close <N> --repo $REPO --comment "Closing: <reason>"\`

   c. **Block**: Issue needs human input or a design decision.
      - Remove "triage", add "blocked" label
      - Comment explaining what's needed
      - Command: \`gh issue edit <N> --repo $REPO --remove-label "triage" --add-label "blocked"\`

3. **Review ready backlog** — check if any ready issues should be reprioritized
   based on new context.

4. **Verify acceptance criteria** — every ready issue must have clear, testable
   acceptance criteria. If missing, add them in a comment.

Rules:
- Process at most 10 issues per session
- Priority guidelines:
  - p0-critical: Build broken, data loss, security issue
  - p1-high: Current roadmap phase, blocking other work
  - p2-medium: Useful improvement, aligns with roadmap
  - p3-low: Nice-to-have, future phase work
- Issues from humans (agent-input) get +1 priority bump unless clearly out of scope
- Do NOT implement anything. Grooming is your only job.
- Do NOT create new issues. That's the PM agent's job.
